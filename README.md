## Hello!
My name is Alexis Garc√≠a and I'm a programmer. I'm interested in software development and especially videogames (both development and design). I have some experience in mobile development but I'm eager to explore other areas and keep learning.

## Some more personal stuff
I like to waste my free time in monster-taming videogames, especially where there are dragons. I like dragons (of all kinds) to such an extent that my room is full of them. I speak Spanish (native), English (C1), German (B1) and French (A2-B1), and I would like to learn some more languages in the future. I also read manga sometimes, but it's less often than I would like.
